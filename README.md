# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## About the Project
This project leverages machine learning to recommend the best crops and fertilizers for a specific region based on various environmental factors. It is designed to assist farmers in improving productivity and promoting sustainable farming practices.

## Features
- Analyzes critical factors such as soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- Recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation.
- Suggests optimal fertilizers to maximize yield.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 2200 rows and 8 columns, including:
- **N, P, K:** Soil nutrients levels
- **Temperature, Humidity:** Climatic conditions
- **pH:** Soil acidity or alkalinity
- **Rainfall:** Average rainfall
- **Label:** Target crop

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Inspection:**
   - Displayed the first and last five rows of the dataset.
   - Checked dataset dimensions, missing values, duplicates, and column statistics.
3. **Statistical Summary:** Provided insights into the data distribution and ranges of features.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   ```
2. Open the `Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System` notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Follow the step-by-step code execution to load the dataset and explore the insights.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Key Insights
- The dataset is clean, with no missing or duplicate values.
- Includes an equal distribution of 22 different crop types for recommendations.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement real-time data collection from IoT devices.
- Add more granular recommendations based on geolocation and real-time weather updates.
